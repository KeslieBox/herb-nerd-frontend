# Herb Nerd Ecyclopedia

This is an application created for herb nerds of kinds, near and far! This is currently usable for your personal herbal encyclopedia, but maybe one day it can be an open source application like Wikipedia where anyone can contribute to its resources and shared-knowledge.

## Cloning & Setup

### Frontend Setup

-Fork and clone this repository & run ```git clone <github-repo-code>``` from your terminal

-```cd``` into the directory (I recommend setting up a folder to house both the front and backend and clone both repositories there)

-run ```explorer.exe index.html to get the browser running (note this may be a different command for Mac and sometimes even for Windows users)

-after cloning the frontend to your computer, set up the backend here: https://github.com/KeslieBox/herb-nerd-backend

### Backend Setup

-Fork and clone this repository & run ```git clone <github-repo-code>``` from your terminal

-run ```bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development```

-run ```bundle install```

-run ```rails s``` in the terminal to start your server

-Finally go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser

From here, you can begin using the application and playing around with the database, adding herbs to it, editing what is there to your liking, etc!

Thanks for trying out the app, enjoy herb-nerding out!
